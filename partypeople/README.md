```
In the problem solving party, each guest received a note with a natural
number when entering the party. The note was drawn from a shuffled
note deck. All the numbers were expected to be a pair so that people
with the same number could be a couple for the party. The party host
wrote down the number along with the guestâ€™s name. However, he
found that all the notes were drawn but the name list had odd number of
names. How could he find the solo player? (Assume that only one guest
could not be a couple.)
